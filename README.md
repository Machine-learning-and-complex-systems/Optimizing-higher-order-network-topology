This MATLAB code package optimizes network topology for synchronization of coupled oscillators with higher-order interactions. The current focus is the system with Kuramoto-type coupling function for identical oscillators, the second-order interactions (triangle). The optimization is realized by minimizing the eigenratios or the spread of eigenvalues for the generalized Laplacian matrices. For the undirected network, we rewire the triangle interactions and use simulated annealing to optimize the network synchronizability. For the directed network, we selectively remove directional triangle interactions to optimize synchronizability, and investigate asymmetry for the optimized directed network.

A detailed description on the methods is given in the main text.
